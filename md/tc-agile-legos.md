# _Why a LEGO Simulation?_


-
# Relation to Agile
* Open backlogs that trigger ideating rather than detailed instructions to follow
* Mindful product development rather than a series of tasks to accomplish
* Teams collaborating toward common success rather than competition for score.
* Useful metrics to assess benefits of agile rather than figures the trainers asked to collect
* Continuous improvements rather than winning or losing the game with one try


-
# Backlogs
* A backlog is an invitation for collaboration between a customer and teams
* Should trigger ideating
* Description should be alterable upon further discussion
* Requirements should be nonsystematic


-
# Product Development
* As a developer, the objective is to have clear vision of the requested end product
* Aggregation of backlogs should illustrate the requested end product


-
# Inter Team Collaboration
* Not a competition
* Work toward a common goal

-
# Production Metrics
* Establish convention for measuring productivity


-
# Continuous Improvements
* Sprints should yield progressively more productive results

# Post Game Retro
* Observations?
* How did it feel being on a Scrum team?
* How did short iterations go?
* How accurate were estimations
* If there was another opportunity to play, what would you do differently?
* What was the job of the product owner?
* How did it feel after the first sprint when required items needed to be reworked?
* What did Scrum masters do?
* How will your strategy change if the Product Owner is unavailble during sprints?
* What did you learn?
